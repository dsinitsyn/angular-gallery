<h2> Description </h2>
We are creating a frontend app that allows staff to manage web site content. on the web site. One of the features that needs to be implemented is managing images with tooltips.  Admin can upload images and add special pointer to it. When user hovers this pointer, tooltip appears. Tooltip text is customizable by admin.  We need to create a tool for admin to manage images with tooltips. Admin should be able to see list of images, add image, edit image, delete image. Also with adding or editing images he can add or edit tooltips pointer. Also we need to have a preview mode to test image with tooltip to see how it works for a common user.

Requirements:
<ul>
<li>You should use one of the modern js frameworks.</li>
<li>It is necessary to emulate server interactions. All responses have to be stubed. But please keep in mind that it should be possible to unstub it fast and to change it for real requests.</li>
<li>Markup should be simple but adaptive for mobile devices.</li>
<li>You should create custom functionality for handling tooltips on images, and not use already existing solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Installation </h2>

<li><code>npm install</code></li>
<li><code>bower install</code></li>
<li><code>gulp</code></li>
